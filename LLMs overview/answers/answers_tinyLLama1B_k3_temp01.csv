"When Poland appears in speeches, is it described more as an enemy or a friend?","<|assistant|>
In general, Poland appears in speeches by Russian officials as an enemy rather than a friend. This is because Poland was a key ally of Nazi Germany during World War II, and the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in 1945 led to the occupation of Poland by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union continued to occupy Poland until 1989, when Poland regained independence.

However, there are some exceptions to this generalization. In recent years, Poland has become a key partner of Russia in various areas, including energy, defense, and economic cooperation. Additionally, Poland has been actively seeking closer ties with other European countries, particularly those in the West, and has expressed interest in joining the European Union (EU).

Overall, while Poland appears in speeches by Russian officials as an enemy, it is often portrayed as a potential partner in certain areas, such as energy and defense cooperation."
