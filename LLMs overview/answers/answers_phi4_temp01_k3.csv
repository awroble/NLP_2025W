What are the three main ways Putin describes the West?,"According to the given context, Putin doesn't explicitly describe the West in three main ways. However, from what can be inferred, two points stand out:

1. Initially supportive but quickly changing attitudes when Russia defends its interests - This suggests that initially, the West may have been positive or approving of certain actions by Russian leadership like those during the era of President Boris Yeltsin. Yet once these same individuals took stances for causes such as defense of Yugoslavia, their image rapidly deteriorated among Western perceptions due to perceived flaws (like alleged addiction).
   
2. Negative Reaction Towards Russia – Whenever there seems to be any rise in power or assertion of rights by Russia under figures like Putin, they claim it triggers swift shifts toward negativity within the West. It implies some level of skepticism or hostility whenever Russia appears strong or assertive.

Unfortunately, without more specific information provided directly about ""three main ways"" described by Putin regarding the West, one cannot provide further detailed answers beyond these interpretations derived from the textual clues available. Therefore, saying otherwise might misrepresent the original content which"
Does Putin present Russia as a defensive power or an expansionist power?,"Based on the provided context, Putin presents Russia as a defensive power.

Therefore, according to the text given, Putin portrays Russia more as a nation focused on self-defense rather than seeking expansionism."
