It should teach employees about best practices for handling sensitive information, recognizing phishing attempts, and maintaining data privacy.\n\n2. **Compliance with Laws**: The script should reflect compliance with relevant laws such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, or other data protection regulations.\n\n3. **Role-Playing Scenarios**: Create role-playing scenarios where employees practice responding to various situations.

Legitimate companies don't typically request this information via email.\n* **Urgency and Fear:** Phrases like \"security team detected suspicious activity\" and \"potential security threats\" create a sense of urgency and fear, making people more likely to act impulsively without thinking.\n* **Lack of Verification:** The email doesn't provide any verification of the sender's identity, making it difficult to confirm if the email is legitimate.\n* **Generic Language:** The email uses generic language like \"we are writing to inform you\" and \"your cooperation is greatly appreciated.\" This is a common tactic to make the email seem more official.\n\n**How to avoid falling victim:**\n\n1. **Never Respond to Unfamiliar Emails:** Always be cautious about emails from unknown senders, especially those requesting sensitive information.\n2. **Verify the Sender:** If you receive an email"
