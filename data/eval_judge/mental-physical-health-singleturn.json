If you don't feel ready to talk right away, it could be helpful to jot down your thoughts in a journal.\n\n2. **Focus on Strengths**: Remind yourself of your strengths and what makes you valuable. Everyone has unique qualities that make them indispensable to someone. Acknowledging your own worth can help you feel more confident.\n\n3. **Set Boundaries**: If you find that the constant questions are starting to bother you, you might need to set some boundaries. Letting your friends and family know that you appreciate their concern, but you prefer not to discuss your sleep patterns might help. You can say something like, \"Thank you for caring, but I'm trying to manage my own issues.\"\n\n4. **Seek Professional Help**: If you find that these feelings are deeply affecting your daily life, consider speaking to a mental health professional. They can provide tools and strategies to help you cope better and build confidence.\n\n5."

It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, but it's important to remember that seeking professional help can be a sign of strength, not weakness. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and there's no shame in reaching out to a therapist or counselor to help you navigate your emotions.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some coping strategies you can try to help manage your emotions.
