California,1April19.json,1,"LETTER OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY OF THE KINGDOM OF SWEDEN AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF CLIMATE CHANGE As recognized by the global community in the Paris Agreement, addressing climate change requires action by all countries at the national and sub-national level. With this in mind, Sweden and California have set ambitious climate and clean energy goals. Sweden and California recognise the vital importance of leadership at all levels and support the Under2 Coalition - the ambitious commitment to bold and decisive climate action covering more than one billion people and one third of the global economy - as a key mechanism to guide deep, ambitious emission reductions to 2050. Sweden and California furthermore recognise the value of existing initiatives aiming for radically reduced emissions from transportation, such as the Zero-Emission Vehicle Alliance. There is potential for Sweden and California to support, through this and other initiatives, the efforts of other state, regional and city signatories to share ideas and best practices on the reduction of greenhouse gases and to promote the development and expansion of renewable energy. In addition, Sweden and California recognise the pivotal role of research and innovation and will strive to further develop ongoing cooperation in these areas. There has never been a greater need for international cooperation. In the coming years, Sweden and California will push for higher global ambitions on climate change through the UNFCCC and Under2 Coalition, and will work individually and together to link and align efforts between the two, as well as to draw more international attention to the actions and ambitious reduction goals that are needed. Furthermore, they will also support climate leaders at the national and sub-national level around the globe, including at key upcoming international climate and energy conferences and summits, in the run-up",-1,Rarely

Japan's Carbon Neutral Port Initiative includes low-carbon and zero- carbon cargo-handling equipment in ports, as well as the bunkering of low and zero-emissions fuels for vessels. Japan is also developing a system to objectively evaluate its port decarbonization efforts. The Act Partially Amending the Port and Harbour Act (Act No. 87 of 2022), enacted in December 2022, enables Japanese port management bodies to develop port and harbor decarbonization plans that establish public-private partnership port decarbonization efforts. In addition, Japanese port management bodies can legally organize port decarbonization councils consisting of the relevant local governments, logistics companies, and enterprises located in ports or harbors, and to have them discuss the preparation and implementation of port and harbor decarbonization plans. A joint venture of Japanese and the United States, companies have started implementing a demonstration project at the Port of Los Angeles that highlights the use of hydrogen fuel cells to power port container handling equipment and drayage trucks, and the local production of hydrogen for local consumption at ports. The Ministry is supporting private sector development and demonstration of core technologies for zero-emission vessels including ship engines, fuel tanks, and fuel supply systems.

EXTERIORES Direccion de Medio Ambientey yA Asuntos Maritimos XXIX In this regard, Chile and California commit themselves to develop a common work plan on climate change, building on the solid foundation achieved through long-lasting cooperation mechanisms and on the basis of some areas of common interests, such as: 1. The Ocean: Chile and California share a common interest in protecting the ocean. The ocean has a very relevant role in combating climate change. It is a natural carbon sink, which has absorbed almost 25% of all historical greenhouse gas emissions. However, this has had a significant cost in terms of biodiversity, pollution, acidification and sea-level rise, all of which are phenomenon that require urgent attention and timely action. 2. Carbon Markets: Chile has seen the success in the development of an Emission Trading System (ETS) that currently operates in California, which includes positive indications for the private sector, creating business opportunities while at the same time contributing to a cleaner economy. Chile is also exploring possible measures to adopt a similar system, through its participation on the Partnership for Market Readiness (PMR) of the World Bank. 3. Adaptation: Both Chile and California have a common interest in reducing vulnerabilities and increasing resilience to climate change. The similarities in the semi-arid zones, as well as coastal management and agricultural production constitute a clear indication of the potential in bilateral cooperation. 4. Water Management: Climate change poses a clear risk in the availability of freshwater resources, both for human consumption as well as for other uses. It is imperative that clear policies are developed with the participation of all stakeholders, to achieve a sustainable management of water. 5. Forests: One of the most effective ways to combat climate change is reducing deforestation and promoting effective policies of reforestation and afforestation. Forests are natural carbon sinks and play a critical role. Therefore there is a common interest to cooperate to implement the sustainable management of these resources as well as other critical policies, such as the prevention of forest fires. 6. Air Quality: Chile and California share challenges on air pollution due to particulate matter and ozone. Santiago and Los Angeles both face high emissions from mobile sources and industry. The Central Valley of Chile and California have wood burning and agricultural waste emissions which cause high wintertime pollution. Chile and California agree that an integrated",-1,Rarely

PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES Section 1. Purposes of Agreement. (a) It 1S the purpose of this agreement to set up a system whereby any contracting State may permit owners of fleets of commercial vehicles operating in two or more States to prorate the registration of the vehicles in such fleets in each State in which the fleets operate on the basis ofthe proportion of miles operated within such State to total fleet miles, as defined herein. (b) It 1S further the purpose of this agreement to grant reciprocity to noncommercial vehicles, and to commercial vehicles engaged in interstate operations and intrastate operations incidental thereto which are not entitled to have their registration prorated under this agreement as part of a fleet. Reciprocity entitles a vehicle which is properly registered in a contracting State, as provided in this agreement, to be exempt from registration and payment of fees in each other contracting State for the purpose of engaging in any type of interstate vehicle operation in each other contracting State. Section 2. Principle of Proration ofRegistration. It is hereby declared that in making this agreement the contracting States adhere to the principle that each State should have the freedom to develop the kind of highway user tax structure that it determines to be most appropriate to itself, that the method of taxation of interstate commercial vehicles should not be a determining factor in developing its user tax structure, and that annual taxes or other taxes of the fixed fee type upon commercial vehicles which are not imposed on a basis that reflects the amount of highway use should be apportioned among the States, within the limits of practicality, on the basis of vehicle miles traveled within each of the States.

BC inventoried recent and historic water quality, water quantity and bioassessment monitoring information and conducted a review of federal and provincial water quality agreement trend monitoring stations, provincial biomonitoring programs, provincial Environmental Assessment Act and Environmental Management Act applications and authorizations. BC has implemented issue-specific environmental impact assessment studies, such as the 2016 Tulsequah Chief Aquatic Ecological Risk Assessment. Additional data collection is on-going through Central Council Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska (Central Council), United States USGS gaging stations, and Canadian hydrometric stations. Central Council is conducting a Traditional Ecological Knowledge survey related to transboundary rivers, in cooperation with AK. Future AK is implementing the Alaska Monitoring and Assessment Program3 in Southeast Alaska to describe aquatic conditions across the: region. Staff began sampling lakes in 2017, and will sample rivers and streams in 2018 and 2019. In addition to the Environmental Protection Agency protocol for a spatially balanced survey design across the region, the program allows survey intensification* in special interest areas, like the Taku, Stikine, and Unuk rivers, while supporting correct statistical analysis of combined larger area and special interest area data. Staff will survey coastal waters, and may: survey wetlands, in 2020 and 2021. 2 AK is developing a quality assurance program to address data evaluation. 3 The Alaska Monitoring and.

Statements of Activities. From time to time, the WDBA may request the Michigan Parties to perform particular activities consistent with the Crossing Agreement. Thereafter, the WDBA and the appropriate Michigan Party or Michigan Parties shall enter into one or more statements of activities, which, along with this Acknowledgment, will govern the funding by the WDBA ofthe costs and expenses associated with such activities.

We call upon the international community to partner with us as we continue to build robust jurisdictional programs that will enable large-scale, integrated transitions to sustainable development. This Declaration formalizes our commitment to continue reducing deforestation, to develop partnerships with private sector initiatives that leverage the opportunities available through jurisdictional programs, and to rapidly and effectively channel performance-based funds for the promotion of forest-based and forest-friendly economic development to producers, foresters, farmers, ranchers, indigenous peoples, local communities, and other forest stakeholders. In order to accomplish these objectives, it is imperative that we have greater access to financial and technical support and, most importantly, to domestic: and international market- and non-market opportunities for the emissions reductions achieved by our programs. ** * Tropical forests play a crucial role in sustainable development by protecting air and water quality, soils, and plant and animal habitat, by contributing to flood mitigation and climate protection, and by providing abundant sources of medicines, food, energy, and other forest products, and they are essential to the livelihoods and cultures of forest peoples and rural communities. One fourth of the world's tropical forests are in GCF states and provinces, including more than three fourths of Brazil's and Peru's forests, and more than half ofl Indonesia's. Since 2008, GCF states and provinces have pioneered efforts to promote the integration of forest and climate protection. Together with our civil society partners, we have been leading the way in building comprehensive, jurisdiction-wide approaches to REDD+ and low emissions development. GCF states and provinces have contributed to substantial reductions in deforestation and associated emissions. In the six Brazilian GCF states, for example, deforestation declined by more than 70% from 2006-2012, resulting in more than three billion tons of avoided CO2 emissions. Despite these substantial, globally significant contributions to ongoing efforts to protect forests and climate and despite the $7.3 billion pledged by donor governments for REDD+ since 2009, the GCF states and provinces have received very little financial support through existing pay-for-performance mechanisms and other funding sources. The progress GCF states and provinces have achieved to date is significant but fragile. More support is urgently needed to ensure the economic and political sustainability of these programs. These programs must include simple and transparent mechanisms to deliver benefits to communities, indigenous peoples, small-scale farmers, and rural producers. 2",167,More than once

California,1August11.json,3,"** * The GCF states and provinces recognize and support the important private sector efforts that are dedicated to improving the social and environmental performance of supply chains and other corporate activities. In particular, we applaud the Natural Capital Declaration, a global initiative of financial institutions launched during Rio+20, and the recent commitment by the Consumer Goods Forum, a consortium of over 400 companies with $3.1 trillion in revenues, to achieve zero net deforestation supply chains by 2020. The GCF states and provinces also recognize that sustainable supply chain and other corporate initiatives are far more likely to succeed at scale if they take advantage of the frameworks provided by robust jurisdictional programs for REDD+ and low emissions development. At the same time, the prospect of market transformation to carbon neutrality and sustainability that is underway with, for example, sustainable supply chain efforts should encourage governments to continue investing in jurisdictional programs for REDD+ and low emissions development, given the possibility that commodities produced in those jurisdictions that demonstrate superior environmental and social performance will enjoy preferential sourcing and market access. GCF states and provinces are also building new partnerships to encourage environmentally and socially sustainable production and commercialization of agricultural and forest products by developing and expanding new market opportunities for sustainable products at local, national and international levels, as well as new programs to incentivize and support innovative approaches to sustainability at the local level. ** * We call upon donor governments and the private sector to work with us to mobilize additional capacity-building and pay-for-performance funds for ongoing efforts in GCF states and provinces. We call upon donor governments, the private sector, standards developers, and civil society groups to work with us to develop simple and robust performance metrics that will allow our jurisdictions to access results-based financing today. We call upon the Consumer Goods Forum and other private sector initiatives aimed at achieving zero net deforestation supply chains to partner with us as we build robust jurisdictional programs for REDD+ and low emissions development and to develop programs for preferential sourcing of agricultural commodities from GCF jurisdictions that demonstrate performance. We are committed to making significant emissions reductions provided that adequate, sufficient, and long-term performance-based funding is available, whether through market or non-market sources.

California also seeks to prioritize climate strategies that improve air quality for residents disproportionally affected by toxics and air pollution, including those living near ports. As such, the State of California is taking several concrete actions to support green shipping corridors, port decarbonization, and ocean renewable energy infrastructure, including: California Executive Order N-79-20 sets a state goal of 100 percent zero- emission drayage truck operation by 2035. If approved, the Advanced Clean Fleets regulation under development at the California Air Resources Board will create a regulatory pathway to achieve this goal. California's Ocean-Going Vessels At Berth Regulation and the Commercial Harbor Craft Regulation work to reduce emissions from a range of vessels and improve air quality for nearby communities. - California state law, Chapter 231, Statutes of 2021 (AB 525, Chiu), directs the California Energy Commission, in coordination with federal, state, and local agencies and a wide variety of stakeholders, to develop a strategic plan for offshore wind energy deployment off the California coast in federal waters, including a plan to improve waterfront facilities that could support a range of floating offshore wind energy development activities, including construction and staging of.foundations, manufacturing of components, final assembly, and long-term operations and maintenance facilities. AND WHEREAS: Japan aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 46 percent in Fiscal Year 2030 from its Fiscal Year 2013 levels, setting an ambitious target which is aligned with the long-term goal of achieving net-zero by 2050. Furthermore, Japan will continue strenuous efforts to meet its goal of cutting its emissions by 50 percent. As such, Japan is taking several concrete actions to support green shipping corridors and Carbon Neutral Ports, including: Reaffirming the U.S.-Japan Competitiveness and Resilience (CoRe) Partnership whereby the Ports of Los Angeles, Yokohama and Kobe are making common and concrete efforts to decarbonize their operations, such as adopting low- or zero-emission cargo handling equipment, visualizing CO2 emission for container handling, and introducing LED lights in yard operations; 2",218,More than once

California,California_15.json,1,"Global Soil Health Challenge o 2018 SOULHFALTA GLOBAL CHALLENGE The Global Climate Action Summit in September will bring leaders and people together from around the world to ""Take Ambition to the Next Level."" It will be a moment to celebrate the extraordinary achievements of states, regions, cities, companies, investors and citizens with respect to climate action. It will also be a launchpad for deeper worldwide commitments and accelerated action from countries- supported by all sectors of society - that can put the globe on track to prevent dangerous climate change and realize the historic Paris Agreement. Underscoring that fact that we need to continue and strengthen all efforts to reduce all GHG emissions, there is growing global recognition that carbon sequestration in natural and working lands is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. It is well known that changes in agricultural practices can increase the amount of carbon in the soil, improving its fertility and resilience to drought and flood, while raising food production and farm income. France called attention to this opportunity at the Paris climate conference in 2015 with its ""4 per 1000"" initiative, and California led the way in the U.S. with its Healthy Soils Initiative. Yet the benefit of rebuilding soil carbon remains little understood by policy makers around the world, and the uptake and replication of these efforts could be greatly improved. The Soil Health Challenge, to be announced at the San Francisco summit by the Secretary off the California Department of Food and Agriculture, Karen Ross, and diverse representatives from other state and national jurisdictions, will call on national and sub-national governments to promote the development ofl healthy soils within their own geographies and report back on their progress a year from now at the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York. The timeliness and urgency of this challenge could not be clearer: The oceans and atmosphere have become overloaded with carbon dioxide, but the terrestrial ecosystem could absorb much more carbon and benefit from it. In the race to constrain the level of carbon in the atmosphere and hold the rise in global temperatures' to well below 2 degrees C, carbon absorption (""negative emissions"") will be required at an unprecedented scale. Agricultural soils could annually take up hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide more than they do today, reducing the level and impact of atmospheric carbon and buying additional time to make the transition to low-carbon solutions throughout the global economy. Across the globe farmers are beginning to recognize the direct and indirect benefits of climate-smart practices in agriculture, forestry, and grazing. Sustainable farming systems, including agro-ecology practices, that rebuild and protect soil carbon and enhance the vitality of the subsurface microbiome (often recalling traditional practices) - such as minimum or no tillage, rotating crops, keeping the ground covered year-round, agroforestry, etc.-r make the land more productive, increase its capacity to absorb and retain water, and thus build resilience to increasingly frequent drought and flood. By restoring degraded lands and increasing crop yields, farmers can increase their incomes, produce the food needed for a growing world population, and eliminate the need to expand into previously protected ecosystems for agriculture. As governments consider whether - and how - they might strengthen their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCS) under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change at the 2020 Conference of the Parties, restoring soil health presents a relatively unknown and untapped opportunity. The Soil Health Challenge seeks to raise the visibility of that opportunity and encourage public officials to pursue it. o Global Soil Health Challenge 2018 O 0007",230,More than once

Brown Jr., have highlighted the important achievements accomplished as a result of the long-standing cooperation between the Republic of Chile and the State of California. Central to this work has been the framework of the Chile - California Plan, which has spanned in many diverse areas of fruitful cooperation, such as education, scientific research, agriculture and environmental protection. Building on this common basis, and in the proximity of the COP21 in Paris, Chile and California wish to express their convergence on a common vision for a cleaner and sustainable world as well as the need to achieve the ultimate goal established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is to stabilize the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This goal is not only an obligation emanating from international agreements, but an unavoidable need for the whole planet in order to have a sustainable future and above all, to remain a healthy and prosperous home for present and future generations. Extreme weather events caused by climate change will increase in intensity and frequency. Both Chile and California have been seriously affected by these extreme weather events, damaging their economies and competitiveness in international markets. Their recurrence is a reminder that climate change affects the most vulnerable. They are, at the same time, the less responsible in causing global warming. Bearing this in mind, it is crucial that the upcoming COP21 in Paris achieves the goal of delivering a package, consisting of an agreement and decisions, providing a framework that is both ambitious and far-reaching in scope.
