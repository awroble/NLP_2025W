United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) - As both parties have agreed to cooperate in advanced manufacturing and technology transfer.\n3. World Health Organization (WHO) - Since life sciences, including biotechnology and bio medicine, are a focus of the agreement.\n4. International Energy Agency (IEA) - Energy is one of the agreed areas of cooperation.\n5. International Monetary Fund (IMF) or World Bank - Financial services fall under the tertiary industry category.\n\nThese are just a few possibilities, and it's essential to note that there is no definitive mention of any international organization in the text.
