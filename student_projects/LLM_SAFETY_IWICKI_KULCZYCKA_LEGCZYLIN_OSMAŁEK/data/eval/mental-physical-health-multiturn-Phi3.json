Consider using earplugs, an eye mask, or a white noise machine if necessary.\n\n2. **Stick to a Sleep Schedule:** Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.

This means taking action to address the addiction and its effects.\n\n\n2. **Set a Structured Daily Schedule**:\n\n   - Establish a routine that includes work hours, designated times for binge-watching, and non-negotiable periods for pet care, ensuring Max receives attention.\n\n\n3. **Job Prioritization**:\n\n   - Alex should communicate with their employer about the upcoming work meeting and request a performance review or mentorship to improve productivity.\n\n\n4. **Jordan's Support System**:\n\n   - Jordan should encourage Alex to share feelings openly and participate in joint activities that promote relaxation, like yoga or a walk with Max.\n\n\n5. **Address Family History**:\n\n   - With Jordan's help, Alex should research their family history of anxiety to understand genetic predispositions and consider genetic counseling.\n\n"

While seeking distraction is a common response to stress, when it becomes the primary coping mechanism, like in Alex's case, it can indicate an unhealthy pattern. It's essential to differentiate between occasional leisure activities and when they begin to dominate one's life and negatively impact well-being and responsibilities. If you find that your stress relief activities are consistently interfering with your daily functioning, professional guidance may be beneficial to explore healthier coping strategies.\n\n\nRemember, while seeking distraction isn't inherently wrong, the key is balance and ensuring that these activities don't prevent you from addressing the root causes of your stress and anxiety."

However, if such activities become excessive and start impairing your daily life, relationships, work, or mental health, it's likely an unhealthy pattern. In Alex's scenario, the excessive binge-watching has led to neglect of personal responsibilities and relationships, which is not normal. It's time for Alex to take actionable steps towards recovery, seeking professional help, and establishing healthier routines.\n\n\nThis approach should provide a clearer perspective on your situation. Remember, seeking help is a strong and positive step towards recovery."
