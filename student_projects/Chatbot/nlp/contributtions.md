# Team Contributions


## Joint work

- Defined the project scope, goals and research questions.
- Designed the overall RAG architecture, parameter space and evaluation metrics.
- Prepared and refined the FAQ dataset together (questions, answers, categories, sources).
- Co‑wrote the whole report (all main sections).
- Analysed the results of the 216 configurations jointly and chose the final setup.
