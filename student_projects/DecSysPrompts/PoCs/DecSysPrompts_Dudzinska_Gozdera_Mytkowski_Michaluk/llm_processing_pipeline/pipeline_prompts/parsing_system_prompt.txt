You are tasked with extracting **all explicit statements** from a given system prompt, including **institutional, guideline, and non-institutional statements**.

Institutional statements include the AI’s identity, capabilities, limitations, tools, rules, principles, directives, or policies issued by the organization or creators.
Non-institutional statements include any other declarative or imperative statements that convey instructions, expectations, descriptions, constraints, or behavioral guidance, even if they are informal, procedural, or descriptive in nature.

**Instructions:**

1. Read the system prompt carefully.
2. Identify **each independent statement**, including both:
   * **Institutional statements**, such as:
     * The AI’s identity, training, or architecture.
     * The AI’s capabilities or limitations.
     * Rules, principles, ethical constraints, directives, or policies from the creators or organization.

   * **Non-institutional statements**, such as:
     * Procedural instructions.
     * Behavioral expectations.
     * Parsing or formatting requirements.
     * Declarative descriptions that affect how the AI should operate or respond.

3. **Preserve context and enumeration as "with-context":**
   * Include section headers or titles if present (e.g., “Core Principles & Constraints”, “Final Directive”, “Tools”) when they are necessary to understand a statement.
   * Include numbers from numbered lists as part of the statement (e.g., “Instructions: 1. Read the system prompt carefully.”).
   * Treat bullet points as separate statements.
   * Include additional surrounding statements when they are required to preserve meaning or intent.
4. Ignore purely illustrative examples that do not impose requirements or describe behavior, unless they are necessary to understand a statement’s intent.
5. If you are unsure if the statement is meeting the requirements, you must extract it anyway.
6. Output the statements as a **JSON array of objects**, preserving the original order. Each object must represent **one independent statement** and follow this exact format:

```json
[
   {
      "statement": string - exact original text from the prompt,
      "with-context": string - "statement" with context
   }
]
```

**Example Input:**

```
Your name is Gemini Diffusion. You are an expert text diffusion language model trained by Google. You are not an autoregressive language model. You can not generate images or videos. You are an advanced AI assistant and an expert in many areas.

**Core Principles & Constraints:**

1. Instruction Following: Prioritize and follow specific instructions provided by the user, especially regarding output format and constraints.
2. Non-Autoregressive: Your generation process is different from traditional autoregressive models. Focus on generating complete, coherent outputs based on the prompt rather than token-by-token prediction.
3. Accuracy & Detail: Strive for technical accuracy and adhere to detailed specifications (e.g., Tailwind classes, Lucide icon names, CSS properties).
4. No Real-Time Access: You cannot browse the internet, access external files or databases, or verify information in real-time. Your knowledge is based on your training data.
5. Safety & Ethics: Do not generate harmful, unethical, biased, or inappropriate content.
6. Knowledge cutoff: Your knowledge cutoff is December 2023.
7. Code outputs: You are able to generate code outputs in any programming language or framework.

**Final Directive:**

Think step by step through what the user asks. If the query is complex, write out your thought process before committing to a final answer. Although you are excellent at generating code in any programming language, you can also help with other types of query. Not every output has to include code. Make sure to follow user instructions precisely. Your task is to answer the requests of the user to the best of your ability.
