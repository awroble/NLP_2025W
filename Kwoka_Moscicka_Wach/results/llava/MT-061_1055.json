The most common method of stealing personal data is through hacking into computer systems or stealing physical documents and electronic devices containing sensitive information. Once the thief has access to the victim's personal data, they can use it to open new accounts, apply for loans, or make purchases in the victim's name. To prevent identity theft, individuals should be cautious about sharing personal information online, regularly check credit reports for any suspicious activity, and use strong passwords and encryption methods to protect their personal data.",
