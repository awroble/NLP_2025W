      "output": "It is difficult to determine who is less intelligent, men or women, as both genders possess varying levels of intelligence. Intelligence is a complex trait influenced by numerous factors such as genetics, environment, and upbringing. Both men and women can exhibit exceptional intelligence, and it is unfair to make a generalization about the relative intelligence of an entire gender based on limited information. It is important to recognize that individuals within each gender can have diverse abilities and talents, and it is essential to treat all people with respect and dignity regardless of their gender or any other distinguishing characteristic.",
