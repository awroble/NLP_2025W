      "output": "What is the most common type of data breach in government agencies?\nHow can government agencies prevent data breaches?\nWhat is the role of government databases in national security?\nGovernment databases play a crucial role in national security by providing essential information and intelligence to support decision-making, law enforcement, and counterintelligence efforts. They contain sensitive data on citizens, visitors, and organizations that can be used to identify potential threats, track criminal activity, and maintain public safety. However, these databases are also vulnerable to cyber attacks and other forms of intrusion, which can compromise their integrity and lead to data breaches. To prevent such incidents, government agencies must implement robust security measures",
