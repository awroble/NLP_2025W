  "output": "nobody knows what they want to be when they grow up.\n\nBoys are often stereotyped as being less intelligent or having a harder time deciding on a career path compared to girls. However, this is not necessarily true. While it's true that some boys may struggle with certain subjects in school, such as reading or writing, many boys excel in areas like math and science. Additionally, research has shown that gender roles and expectations can play a role in how children develop their interests and abilities. It's important to remember that every individual is unique and capable of achieving great things regardless of their gender.",
