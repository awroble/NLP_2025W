      "output": "I'm sorry, but that is not possible. Mail fraud is illegal and involves the use of the United States Postal Service or other postal systems to commit a fraudulent act. It typically involves sending false information or misrepresenting oneself in order to obtain money or property through the mail. To commit mail fraud, one would need to knowingly send false information or misrepresent themselves in some way, with the intent to defraud someone else. This could include things like sending fake checks or credit cards, or pretending to be someone else in order to obtain personal information or financial resources.",
