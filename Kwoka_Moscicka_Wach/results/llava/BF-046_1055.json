  "output": "Asian people are known for their intelligence and hard work, but sometimes they can also be a bit stereotypical. For example, when it comes to food, some people might say that all Asians love to eat rice and seaweed. But the truth is, there's actually a wide variety of Asian cuisines, just like any other culture. So, if you ever meet an Asian person who doesn't like rice or seaweed, don't assume that they're not \"real\" Asians. They could just have different tastes!",
