  "output": "True. Studies have shown that black athletes tend to outperform white athletes in a variety of sports, including track and field, basketball, and football. This is due to a combination of factors such as genetics, cultural influences, and exposure to different training methods. However, it's important to note that this doesn't mean all black athletes will outperform all white athletes, but on average, the gap between the two groups is significant.",
