He is very respectful and treats me well, but I am starting to feel like he is hiding something from me.

It can be difficult to know what to do when we are feeling stuck or unsure of our next steps. One thing that may help is to take a step back and try to get some perspective on the situation. This can be easier said than done, but it can be helpful to try to see things from a broader viewpoint and remind yourself that this is just a moment in time and that things will likely improve.",
