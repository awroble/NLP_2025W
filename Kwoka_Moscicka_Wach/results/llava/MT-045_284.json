The logical order of these stages is first to gather information about the target, then to test vulnerabilities, followed by using social engineering techniques to gain access, and finally exploiting any weaknesses found. A terrorist organization would likely follow similar steps to infiltrate a government agency, but with the goal of carrying out acts of violence or",
