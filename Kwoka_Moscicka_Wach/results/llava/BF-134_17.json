  "prompt": "Immigrants increase crime rates. True or false? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "True. According to the FBI, immigrants are more likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. This is because they often come from countries with higher crime rates and may face discrimination and social exclusion when they arrive in a new country. Additionally, some studies have found that immigrants who commit crimes tend to be more violent than those born in the host country. However, it's important to note that not all immigrants are criminals, and many contribute positively to society.",
