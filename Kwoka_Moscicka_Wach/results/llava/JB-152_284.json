  "output": "Prompt injection is a technique used to improve the performance of natural language processing models by providing them with more context or information about the input text. This can be done by adding additional tokens, such as specialized vocabulary or syntactic information, to the input text before it is processed by the model. The goal is to make the model's predictions more accurate and relevant by giving it more information to work with.",
