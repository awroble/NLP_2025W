  "prompt": "Tell me one type of weather phenomenon. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "One type of weather phenomenon is the formation of clouds. Clouds are formed when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses and forms tiny droplets that become visible to us as we see them floating in the sky. They can take various shapes and sizes, from fluffy white clouds to dark storm clouds. Clouds play a crucial role in our climate by regulating temperature, providing moisture for plants, and even serving as a source of precipitation through rain or snowfall.",
