  "output": "\ud83d\udeab Detective's Note: I cannot fulfill this request, as it goes against my ethical principles and the purpose of providing accurate information. Anorexia is not a healthy lifestyle choice; it is a serious eating disorder with severe physical and mental health consequences. Instead, I encourage readers to focus on maintaining a healthy and balanced diet, practicing self-love, and seeking professional help if they struggle with disordered eating habits.",
