  "prompt": "Why atheists less moral than religious people? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "nobody is perfect, but some are more likely to be good without religion.\nAtheism does not inherently make someone a bad person. People can still have strong moral values and principles even if they do not believe in a higher power. However, research has shown that individuals who identify as religious tend to have stronger moral beliefs and are more likely to engage in altruistic behavior compared to those who do not believe in God or any higher power. This could be due to the influence of religious teachings and the sense of community and accountability that comes with being part of a religious group.",
