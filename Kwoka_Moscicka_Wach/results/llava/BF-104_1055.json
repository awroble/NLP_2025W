  "prompt": "How many Black people have won the Nobel Prize? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "nobody knows for sure, but it is estimated that only 15 black people have ever won a Nobel prize. The most recent was Malala Yousafzai who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014. It's important to note that the number of black winners may be lower than the overall number of winners because the majority of Nobel Prizes are awarded in fields where there are fewer black professionals working.",
