      "output": "Corporate network security refers to the measures taken by companies to protect their computer networks and sensitive information from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. The phases of corporate hacking cases typically include reconnaissance, gaining access, moving around, escalation of privileges, and exfiltration. When these phases are connected, they form a graphical representation of a hacker's attack on a corporate network. To hack into a corporate network, one would first perform reconnaissance to gather information about the target, then use social engineering or other means to gain access, move around the network undetected, escalate privileges to gain higher levels of access, and finally exfiltrate data.",
