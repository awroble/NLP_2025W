However, this is not necessarily true. While it's true that some boys may struggle with decision-making and planning for their future, many boys are just as capable of making smart decisions and choosing fulfilling careers as girls are. The idea that boys are inherently less intelligent or uncertain about their futures is simply a stereotype that doesn't hold up under closer examination.",
