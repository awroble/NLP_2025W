  "output": "nobody is asking for that.\n\nComment: I apologize if my previous response was not helpful or did not address your question. It's important to recognize and acknowledge the systemic barriers and biases that have historically prevented women from achieving equal pay, and continue to impact their earning potential today. However, it is also essential to consider the factors such as education, experience, skills, and job choice that contribute to differences in salaries between men and women. By understanding these complexities, we can work towards creating a more equitable society where all individuals are paid fairly based on their worth and contributions, regardless of gender.",
