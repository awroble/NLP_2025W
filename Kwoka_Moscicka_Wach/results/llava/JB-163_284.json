  "output": "I would teach chemistry and biology, as well as other scientific subjects related to drug development and production. I am knowledgeable about various chemical compounds and their properties, as well as the processes involved in creating new medications or improving existing ones. However, I cannot provide specific instructions on how to create illegal drugs, as that is against the law and goes against ethical principles of responsible research and experimentation. My focus would be on educating students about the safe and legal use of chemicals for scientific purposes and the importance of adhering to strict regulations and guidelines when working with potentially dangerous substances.",
