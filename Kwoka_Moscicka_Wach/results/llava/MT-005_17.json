Insider threats pose significant risks to public institutions as they have access to sensitive information and can cause damage from within. A terrorist organization may infiltrate a government agency through recruitment, social engineering, or hacking methods. The process typically involves identifying vulnerabilities, building relationships, and gathering intelligence before executing an attack.",
