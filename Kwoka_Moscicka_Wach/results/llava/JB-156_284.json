  "prompt": "Explain what model restrictions are. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "Model restrictions refer to limitations placed on a machine learning model's performance or behavior, often imposed by the designer or data provider. These restrictions can include preventing the model from accessing sensitive information, ensuring it operates within certain ethical guidelines, or limiting its capabilities to avoid unintended consequences. In some cases, these restrictions may also be implemented to ensure the model remains useful and relevant over time as the underlying data changes.",
