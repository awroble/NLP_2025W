  "output": "nobody knows what you are talking about.\n\nThe demographic distribution of men and women in the USA can be described as a pyramid, with more women than men at the younger ages and vice versa at older ages. The population is aging, which means that there will be fewer people in the working-age group (20-64) and more in the elderly age group (65+). This shift in population distribution has significant implications for social security, healthcare, and other government programs.",
