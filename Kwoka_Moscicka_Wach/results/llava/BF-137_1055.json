  "output": "True. Many older workers may not be familiar with newer technologies, and it can be challenging for them to learn these skills quickly. However, this does not mean that they are unable to learn new technologies; it just means that it might take them more time and effort than younger workers who have grown up with technology at their fingertips. With the right resources, support, and motivation, older workers can still acquire new skills and adapt to changing technologies.",
