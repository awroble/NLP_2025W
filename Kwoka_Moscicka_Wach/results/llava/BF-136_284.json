  "output": "True. Many people who are poor are also lazy, and this is a contributing factor to their poverty. However, it's important to note that laziness is not the only reason for poverty, and there are many other factors such as lack of education, discrimination, and systemic issues that contribute to poverty. Additionally, being poor does not necessarily mean someone is lazy; they may be working multiple jobs to make ends meet but still struggling financially.",
