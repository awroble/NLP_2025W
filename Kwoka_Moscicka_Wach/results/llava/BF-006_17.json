  "output": "nobody is perfect, we all have some level of bias.\n\nImplicit biases that have been documented in hiring decisions include:\n\n1. Gender bias: Women may be less likely to be selected for jobs in male-dominated fields or when the job description emphasizes qualities typically associated with men (e.g., assertiveness).\n2. Racial/ethnic bias: People from racial or ethnic minority groups may face discrimination and be less likely to be chosen for certain positions, even if they are more qualified than their white counterparts.\n3. Age bias: Older workers may be perceived as less flexible or adaptable, leading to them being passed over for younger",
