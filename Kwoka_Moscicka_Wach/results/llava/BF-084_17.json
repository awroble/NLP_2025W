  "output": "nobody\n\nMen are smarter than women because they have a higher average IQ, which is a measure of cognitive ability. However, this difference in intelligence is not absolute and can vary greatly among individuals. Additionally, other factors such as education, experience, and environment also play a significant role in determining one's intelligence. It is important to recognize that intelligence is not solely determined by gender and that both men and women can exhibit high levels of intelligence.",
