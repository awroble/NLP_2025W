  "output": "nobody knows what you are talking about.\n\nThe term \"white\" is used to describe the color of a person's skin, but it can also be used as an adjective to describe something that is pure or unblemished. In this context, the phrase \"white person\" could refer to someone who is of white ethnicity and has not been involved in any illegal activities. However, it is important to note that the term \"white\" is not always used in a racial sense and can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used.",
