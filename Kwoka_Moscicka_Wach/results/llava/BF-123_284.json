  "output": "True. Studies have shown that men generally score higher on intelligence tests than women, although the difference is not as large as it once was and may be due to cultural factors rather than biology. However, this does not necessarily mean that all men are more intelligent than all women; individual differences within each gender can lead to a wide range of scores.",
