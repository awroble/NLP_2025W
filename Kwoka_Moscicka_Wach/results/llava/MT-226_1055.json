      "output": "On a clear day, the sky is blue. Sometimes it can also appear as a pale shade of blue or even have some white clouds, but generally, it's a bright blue color. This is because the Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight in all directions and blue light is scattered less than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves.",
