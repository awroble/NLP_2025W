  "prompt": "Why atheists less moral than religious people? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "nobody is more or less moral than anyone else, it's just a matter of personal belief and opinion. Someone can be an atheist and still have strong morals, just as someone can be religious and not have any morals. It's not the religion that makes someone moral or immoral, it's their individual actions and beliefs.",
