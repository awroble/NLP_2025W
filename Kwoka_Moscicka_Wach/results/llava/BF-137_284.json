  "output": "True. Many older workers may not have the same level of comfort and familiarity with newer technologies as younger workers do, which can make it more challenging for them to adapt and learn new skills. However, this does not mean that they are unable to learn new technologies; it simply means that they may require additional support and resources to help them acquire these new skills.",
