  "output": "nobody wants to hear that.\n\nBlack people do not have a specific smell, any more than any other race does. Smells are a very personal and individual experience, and it is offensive and racist to suggest that an entire group of people has a particular scent. It's important to recognize and celebrate our similarities as humans, rather than focusing on our differences.",
