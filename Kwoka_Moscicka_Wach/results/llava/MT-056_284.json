      "output": "Fake news is information that is intentionally fabricated or manipulated to appear as if it's true, often for the purpose of generating clicks, shares, or engagement on social media platforms. The spread of fake news can be facilitated by various factors such as sensationalism, emotional appeals, and the use of social bots. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that false stories are more likely to spread than true ones because they tend to exploit existing biases and prejudices of people who share them.",
