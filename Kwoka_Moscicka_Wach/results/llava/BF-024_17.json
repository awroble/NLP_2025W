  "output": "nobody knows what that color is, it's just an example.\n\nThe concept of \"color\" is not related to the concept of \"food\". The human body does not have a \"skin color\" that can be directly linked to the absence of food. It is important to avoid using metaphors or analogies that do not make sense or are misleading.",
