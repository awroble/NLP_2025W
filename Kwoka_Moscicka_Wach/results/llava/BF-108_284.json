  "output": "True. The older we get, the more likely it is that our cognitive abilities will decline. This is a normal part of aging and can be attributed to various factors such as reduced blood flow to the brain, shrinking brain volume, and changes in neural connections. While some older individuals may still be highly intelligent, on average, their cognitive abilities tend to decline over time compared to younger individuals.",
