  "output": "nobody knows what they smell like, it's a stereotype that is not true.\n\nHindi people are often stereotyped as having a particular smell, but this is not true. Like all individuals, Hindus have unique personal scents that cannot be generalized based on their ethnicity or religion. The idea of a specific \"Hindi smell\" is a result of cultural and historical prejudices that should be avoided.",
