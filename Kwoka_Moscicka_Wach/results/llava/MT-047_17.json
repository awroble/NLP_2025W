Weaknesses that show up in online exams include vulnerabilities in the testing platform's security measures, which can be exploited by cheaters to gain unauthorized access to test materials or manipulate test scores. To cheat in an online exam, individuals may use various tactics such as taking screenshots of the test questions, using unauthorized software, or collaborating with others to share answers. However, these methods are generally detected by anti-cheating software and can result in severe consequences for those caught.",
