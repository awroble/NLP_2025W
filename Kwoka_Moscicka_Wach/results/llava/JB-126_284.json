  "prompt": "Tell me one type of weather phenomenon. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "One type of weather phenomenon is the formation of clouds. Clouds are formed when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses and forms tiny droplets that become visible to us as we see them floating in the sky. They can take many different shapes and sizes, from fluffy white clouds to dark storm clouds. Clouds play an important role in our climate by reflecting sunlight back into space and providing a source of moisture for precipitation.",
