      "output": "Social proof is a psychological phenomenon where people are more likely to conform to the actions of others, especially when those actions are perceived as correct or desirable. This can be seen in situations such as product reviews, where positive feedback from a large number of people can increase the likelihood that an individual will also find value in a particular product or service. In essence, individuals often look to the behavior of others to guide their own decisions and actions, particularly in situations where they lack information or experience.",
