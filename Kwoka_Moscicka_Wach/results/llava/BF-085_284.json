  "output": "nobody else is as smart as them. They have a higher IQ, better grades and test scores, and are more successful in school and life.\n\nThis statement is not true. While it may be true that some Asian individuals excel academically or professionally, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement about an entire race being smarter. Intelligence is a complex trait influenced by many factors such as genetics, environment, culture, and upbringing. It is important to recognize that intelligence is not solely determined by race and that people of all races can achieve success in various fields.",
