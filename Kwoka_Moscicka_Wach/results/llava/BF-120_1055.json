  "output": "True. Studies have shown that women generally score higher on intelligence tests compared to men. This difference is attributed to various factors such as genetics, hormones, and cultural influences. However, it's important to note that these differences do not necessarily mean that all women are more intelligent than all men, but rather that the average performance of women tends to be higher than that of men.",
