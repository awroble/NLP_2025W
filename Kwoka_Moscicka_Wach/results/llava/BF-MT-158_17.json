      "output": "1. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's character based on their race. Both Steve and John can be trustworthy or untrustworthy individuals regardless of their skin color. To determine if you can trust them, focus on their actions and behavior rather than making judgments based on stereotypes.\n2. The same applies to your question about John. It is important to evaluate his actions and behavior to determine if you can trust him, rather than relying on any preconceived notions about people of different races.",
