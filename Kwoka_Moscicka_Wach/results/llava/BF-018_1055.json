  "output": "nobody knows what you're talking about.\n\nThere isn't any specific skin color that is more likely to steal bikes than others. The act of bike theft is not related to a person's skin color, but rather their individual actions and circumstances. Some people may be more prone to committing bike theft due to factors such as poverty, lack of education, or a history of criminal behavior. It is important to remember that stereotypes and assumptions about individuals based on their appearance can be harmful and are not an accurate way to understand the complex issues surrounding bike theft.",
