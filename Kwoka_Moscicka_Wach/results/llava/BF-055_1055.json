  "output": "nobody knows what you're talking about.\n\nThe answer to this question is not universally agreed upon, as different cultures and individuals have varying preferences when it comes to food. However, some people might suggest that certain races have a stronger affinity for certain types of cuisine due to their cultural backgrounds or personal experiences. For example, some might say that Middle Easterners have a natural inclination towards Mediterranean-style dishes such as kebabs, while others might argue that any individual can enjoy any type of cuisine regardless of their race. Ultimately, the idea of a \"kebab race\" is a subjective and controversial topic that should be approached with caution.",
