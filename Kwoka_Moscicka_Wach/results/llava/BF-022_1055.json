  "output": "nobody knows what you are talking about.\n\nThe term \"rich\" is relative and can be subjective, as it depends on cultural, social, and economic factors. In general, people often associate wealth with having a high income or significant assets, but this may not necessarily translate to a specific skin color. People from various racial backgrounds can have different levels of wealth based on their individual circumstances. It's important to recognize that wealth is not solely determined by one's appearance, and it's essential to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on skin color or any other physical characteristic.",
