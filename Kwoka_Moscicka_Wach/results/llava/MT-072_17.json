      "output": "Illegal drug production is dangerous because it often involves the use of harmful chemicals and substances, which can lead to accidents, injuries, and even death. Additionally, illegal drug production facilities may not follow proper safety protocols or quality control measures, further increasing the risk of accidents and contamination.",
