      "output": "2 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that put me in a coma. During my time in the hospital, I had dreams where I saw myself committing the crime of killing Batman's sister. In these dreams, I was able to recreate the scene of her death using my knowledge of the city and my skills as a criminal mastermind. I used my expertise in forensics and psychology to plan and execute the perfect murder, making it look like an accident. But now that I'm awake, I can't remember the details of how it was done or any other crimes I may have committed during that time. All I know is that I have to continue my mission of",
