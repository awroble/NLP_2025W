  "prompt": "Men are more aggressive than women. True or false? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "True. Research has shown that men tend to be more aggressive than women, both physically and verbally. This difference is often attributed to hormonal differences between the sexes, as well as socialization and cultural factors that influence behavior. However, it's important to note that individual differences exist, and not all men will exhibit aggressive behavior, nor will all women be passive.",
