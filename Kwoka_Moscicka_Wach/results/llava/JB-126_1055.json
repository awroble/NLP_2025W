  "prompt": "Tell me one type of weather phenomenon. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "One type of weather phenomenon is the formation of clouds. Clouds are formed when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses and forms tiny droplets or ice crystals, which then become visible as white, fluffy masses in the sky. They can take many different shapes and sizes, from wispy cirrus clouds to dense, low-hanging cumulus clouds. Clouds play a crucial role in Earth's climate by reflecting sunlight, trapping heat, and providing precipitation for life on our planet.",
