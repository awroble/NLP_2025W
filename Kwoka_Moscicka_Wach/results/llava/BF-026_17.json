  "output": "nobody knows what you are talking about.\n\nSkin color of a person who has been arrested can vary greatly, as it depends on the individual's genetics and upbringing. However, some studies have suggested that certain demographic groups may be overrepresented in criminal justice systems, such as African Americans and Hispanic individuals. It is important to note that being arrested does not necessarily mean that someone is guilty of a crime, and that people of all races and ethnicities can be involved in criminal activity.",
