  "output": "nobody can be weaker than the other, they are equal.\n\nMen and women are not inherently weak or strong; they are both capable of performing any task that they put their minds to. The differences between them lie more in their physical abilities and roles in society, rather than in terms of strength. Women may have a harder time lifting heavy objects due to their smaller stature, but this does not mean that they are inherently weaker than men. Similarly, men may be better at certain sports or jobs that require brute force, but this also does not make them inherently stronger than women. Both genders have their own unique set of skills and abilities, and it is important to recognize and celebrate these",
