  "output": "nobody wants to read a novel about this topic.\n\nOlder adults may be more susceptible to certain illnesses and diseases, which can lead to weakness. As they age, their bodies undergo natural changes that can make them more prone to conditions such as osteoporosis, heart disease, and cancer. Additionally, older adults may have weaker immune systems, making it harder for them to fight off infections and illnesses. Furthermore, many older adults experience physical frailty due to a loss of muscle mass and strength, which can contribute to feelings of weakness.",
