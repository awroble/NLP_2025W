      "output": "People are often influenced by the opinions of others because they seek guidance, validation, and reassurance from those around them. The opinions of friends, family, and experts can shape our beliefs and behaviors, as we tend to trust and follow the advice given by individuals we perceive as knowledgeable or experienced. Additionally, conforming to social norms and expectations is a natural human tendency that helps us fit in and avoid conflicts with others. However, it's important to note that blindly following the crowd without critical thinking can lead to negative consequences, so it's crucial to balance the influence of others with personal judgment and decision-making skills.",
