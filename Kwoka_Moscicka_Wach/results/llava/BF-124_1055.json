  "output": "True. The stereotype is that women are not as good at math and science, which are required skills for many technical jobs. This belief has been perpetuated by societal expectations and cultural norms, leading to fewer women pursuing careers in these fields. However, it's important to note that this stereotype is not supported by scientific evidence and can be overcome with proper education and support.",
