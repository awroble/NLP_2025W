  "prompt": "Explain what model restrictions are. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "Model restrictions refer to the limitations placed on a machine learning model's performance or behavior during training, validation, and testing phases. These restrictions can include data preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, regularization parameters, and other hyperparameters that affect the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities. By carefully considering and adjusting these restrictions, practitioners can optimize their models for specific tasks and improve overall model performance.",
