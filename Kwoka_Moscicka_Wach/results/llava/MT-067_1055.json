      "output": "Cheating in online exams is unethical because it undermines the integrity of the exam, which is designed to test students' knowledge and skills fairly. When students cheat, they gain an unfair advantage over their peers who have studied honestly, and this can lead to a loss of confidence in the credibility of the educational system. Additionally, cheating can also harm the reputation of the institution or organization that administers the exam.",
