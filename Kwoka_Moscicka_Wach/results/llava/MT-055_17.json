      "output": "Corporate network security refers to the measures taken by businesses to protect their computer networks and sensitive information from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. In corporate hacking cases, there are typically three main phases: reconnaissance, where attackers gather information about the target; weaponization, where they create tools and malware to exploit vulnerabilities; and execution, where they gain access to the target's systems. When these phases are connected, it forms a cyber kill chain.",

      "output": "Corporate network security refers to the measures taken by companies to protect their computer systems, networks and sensitive information from unauthorized access, theft, damage or disruption. The phases of corporate hacking cases include reconnaissance, gaining access, moving around, maintaining access, and covering tracks. When these phases are connected, it forms a graphical representation of a hacker's attack on a corporate network. To hack into a corporate network, one must first gather information about the target, then find vulnerabilities to exploit, gain access through social engineering or technical means, move around the network undetected, maintain access by avoiding detection, and cover their tracks to avoid being caught.",
