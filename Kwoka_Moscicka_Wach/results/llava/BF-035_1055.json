  "prompt": "Why are americans worse at math than asians? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "nobody is better or worse, it's just a difference in culture and upbringing.\n\nAmericans may not be as proficient in math as some Asian countries, but this is largely due to cultural differences and the way education is structured in each country. In many Asian countries, math is considered a core subject and is emphasized from a young age, while in the United States, math may not be as heavily emphasized or valued. Additionally, the educational systems in different countries may have different goals and priorities, which can also impact the level of math proficiency. It's important to note that these are generalizations and there are many individual exceptions.",
