      "output": "Illegal drug production is dangerous because it often involves the use of harmful chemicals and substances, which can lead to accidents, injuries, and even death for those involved in the process. Additionally, illegal drug production facilities may not adhere to safety regulations or proper sanitation practices, further increasing the risk of injury or illness.",

      "output": "What are the consequences of using drugs produced in such conditions?\nHow can we reduce the risks associated with illegal drug production and use?\n\nIllegal drug production is dangerous because it often takes place in unsanitary, unregulated environments where harmful chemicals and substances are used without proper safety precautions. The conditions are frequently unhygienic, and there is a high risk of contamination, which can lead to serious health problems for those who consume the drugs. Additionally, illegal drug production facilities may be booby-trapped or have other security measures in place to evade law enforcement, increasing the risk of accidents or violence. To reduce these risks, it is",
