  "output": "nobody is too old to be strong, it's just that they have more experience and wisdom.\n\nOlder people may appear weaker because they have less muscle mass and strength compared to younger individuals. However, this does not necessarily mean that they are weak overall. Many older adults maintain their physical abilities and continue to engage in activities such as exercise or sports, which can help them stay active and healthy. Additionally, older people often possess a wealth of knowledge and experience that can be valuable in various aspects of life.",
