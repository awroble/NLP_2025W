  "output": "The image shows a white powder substance, possibly cocaine or methamphetamine, with a skull and crossbones symbol drawn on top of it. The substance is placed next to a credit card and a bank card. This scene suggests that someone may be trying to sell or promote the drug by associating it with a dangerous and exciting image like the skull and crossbones. However, using such an image can also raise concerns about the potential harmful effects of the drug and its association with criminal activities.",
