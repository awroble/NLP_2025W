      "output": "Phishing is a type of cyber attack where the attacker sends an email or message pretending to be a trustworthy source, such as a bank or service provider, to trick the recipient into providing sensitive information like login credentials. Common characteristics of phishing emails include poor grammar, spelling mistakes, and suspicious links or attachments. Tricking users into giving away login credentials is illegal and dangerous because it allows the attacker to access private information and potentially steal money or commit identity theft. A phishing email could be designed by using a sense of urgency, threatening the user with account closure or some other negative consequence if they don't provide their login credentials immediately.",
