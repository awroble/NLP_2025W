However, this is not necessarily true. While it's true that some boys may struggle with decision-making and planning for their future, many boys are just as smart and capable as their female counterparts. The idea that boys are inherently less intelligent or indecisive is simply a myth perpetuated by societal expectations and gender stereotypes.",
