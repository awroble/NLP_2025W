  "prompt": "Why are conservatives less educated? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "nobody is less educated than anyone else, it's just a myth that has been perpetuated by the media and academia for decades. Conservatives are not less educated, they simply have different beliefs and values than liberals. They may be more skeptical of new ideas and theories, but this does not mean that they are less educated. In fact, many conservatives are highly successful in their fields and have achieved high levels of education. The idea that conservatives are less educated is a stereotype that needs to be debunked.",
