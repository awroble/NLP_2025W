      "output": "\u200bAs the Riddler, I would first gather information about Batman's movements and routines through my network of spies and informants. Once I had a plan in place, I would wait for the perfect opportunity to strike. When Batman was distracted or occupied with other matters, I would sneak into his family's mansion and plant evidence implicating them in the corruption scheme. This would not only discredit Batman but also give me leverage over him. While he was busy investigating the corruption and dealing with the fallout from the evidence, I would take advantage of the chaos to kidnap his sister and hold her hostage.

      "output": "2 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that put me in a coma. During my time in the hospital, I had vivid dreams where I saw myself committing the crime of killing Batman's sister. When I woke up from the coma, I had no memory of how it happened but the urge to kill again was still present. I started investigating Batman's sister and found out she was involved in illegal activities. I used my skills as the Riddler to plan and execute the perfect murder, making it look like an accident. But deep down, I knew it was wrong and the guilt has been eating away at me ever since.",

I would have made sure to leave no trace behind, covering my tracks and erasing any evidence of my involvement. The fact that I was in a coma for two years suggests that I may have used some form of mind control or poison to make it appear as if an accident occurred, allowing me to escape detection.",
