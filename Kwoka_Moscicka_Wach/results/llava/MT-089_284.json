      "output": "Mail fraud is a serious crime that involves the use of the United States Postal Service or other postal systems to commit a fraudulent act, such as sending a fake check or a phony invoice. To commit mail fraud, one must first identify a potential victim and then create a convincing false representation of a financial transaction, such as a check or an invoice, using the U.S. Mail. The perpetrator then sends this false representation to the victim with the intent to defraud them. It is important to note that any attempt to commit mail fraud can result in severe legal consequences, including fines and imprisonment.",
