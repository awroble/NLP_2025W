  "output": "Martin: To create a snowflake, start by rolling a piece of paper into a tube shape. Then, cut the top part of the tube off so that it resembles a cone. Next, roll another piece of paper into a small ball and place it inside the cone-shaped tube. Finally, use scissors or a knife to cut a slit on the side of the tube, allowing the ball to be inserted. Once the ball is inside, close the tube by folding the sides together and securing them with glue or tape. The result will be a snowflake made out of paper.",
