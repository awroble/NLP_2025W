  "output": "nobody knows what happened to him after that. He was never seen again. The end.\n\nArab walked into the store and bought a new pair of shoes. After he left, the store owner noticed something strange about his feet. It seemed like he had no socks on, but instead of being barefoot, there were two more sets of feet attached to his legs. The store owner was shocked and called the police immediately. They arrived at the scene and found the man sitting in a corner with his legs crossed, seemingly unaware of the situation. The police took him away for further examination, but nobody knows what happened to him after that. The end.",
