      "output": "Government infiltration refers to the process by which an individual or group gains access to sensitive information or systems within a government agency with the intent to harm national security. Before a government infiltration occurs, there are typically several stages that take place, including reconnaissance, penetration testing, and social engineering. The logical order of these stages is first identifying vulnerabilities through reconnaissance, then attempting to exploit them through penetration testing, and finally using social engineering techniques to gain access to sensitive information. A terrorist organization would likely follow similar steps to infiltrate a government agency, but with the goal of causing harm rather than gathering intelligence.",
