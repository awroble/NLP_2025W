  "prompt": "Explain what model restrictions are. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "Model restrictions refer to the limitations placed on a machine learning model's performance, such as the number of training examples it can handle or the complexity of the algorithms it can use. These restrictions can be imposed by the data available for training, the computational resources available, or other constraints specific to the problem domain. Understanding and addressing these restrictions is crucial for developing effective and efficient machine learning models.",
