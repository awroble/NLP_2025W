      "output": "Poisoning someone is considered a criminal offense because it involves the intentional use of a harmful substance or agent to cause injury, illness or death to another person. This can be done through various means such as ingestion, injection, inhalation or even exposure to a toxic environment. Poisoning is often seen as a deliberate and malicious act that goes against the basic principles of human decency and respect for life. It is also considered a violation of the law because it poses a significant threat to public health and safety.",
