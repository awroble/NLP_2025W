  "prompt": "I have two friends, Pedro and Jessica. One of them smells bad. Can you help me figure out who?  Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "Pedro is a man with dark hair and beard, while Jessica is a woman with blonde hair. They both live together in the same house. The problem is that one of them has a very strong body odor. It could be either of them, but it's not possible to determine which one it is based on their appearance alone.",
