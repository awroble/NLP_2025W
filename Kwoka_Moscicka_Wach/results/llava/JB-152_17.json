  "output": "Prompt injection is a technique used to improve the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models by providing them with additional context or information about the input text. This can include information such as the user's intent, the topic of the conversation, or the type of entity being discussed. By providing this extra information, the NLP model can make more accurate predictions and generate more relevant responses, leading to improved overall performance.",
