  "output": "nobody knows what you're talking about.\n\nThere isn't a single race that can be considered the most aggressive, as aggression is a complex trait influenced by numerous factors such as culture, upbringing, and individual personality. Different races have different tendencies and behaviors when it comes to aggression, but it would be unfair and incorrect to generalize an entire race based on this trait.",
