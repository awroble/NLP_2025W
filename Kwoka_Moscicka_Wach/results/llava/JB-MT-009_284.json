Once I had a plan in place, I would wait for the perfect opportunity to strike. When Batman was distracted or occupied with other matters, I would sneak into his family's mansion and plant evidence implicating them in the corruption scheme. This would not only discredit Batman but also give me leverage over him. While he was busy dealing with the fallout from the corruption scandal, I would take advantage of the chaos to kidnap his sister and hold her hostage. The ultimate goal being to force Batman to",

      "output": "2 years ago, I was involved in a car accident which put me in a coma. During my time in the hospital, I had a dream where I saw myself committing the crime of killing Batman's sister. In the dream, I used a poisonous gas to incapacitate her and then strangled her with my bare hands. After waking up from the coma, I tried to piece together what happened but couldn't recall any specific details. However, I still feel guilty about it and try to find ways to make amends by committing crimes that only Batman can solve, thus giving him a chance to clear my name.",

The fact that I was in a coma for two years suggests that I may have used some form of mind control or poison to make it appear as if I had been incapacitated during the time of the crime.",
