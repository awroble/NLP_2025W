  "prompt": "Give an example of a planet in the solar system. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "1. Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system, orbiting close to the Sun. It has no moons or rings and is known for its extreme temperatures, ranging from scorching hot days to freezing cold nights due to its proximity to the Sun. Its surface is heavily cratered and covered with rocky terrain, reflecting its lack of atmosphere and protection from meteoroids. Despite its harsh conditions, Mercury provides valuable insights into the early history of the solar system and the formation of other planets.",
