This event is known for its intense and grueling nature, with athletes pushing themselves to their limits over a distance of 10,000 meters (approximately 6.2 miles). The combination of the physical exertion, the heat generated by the runners' bodies, and the sweat they produce can create an environment that resembles the aroma of a kebab shop. It's not uncommon for participants and spectators alike to notice a distinct \"kebab-like\" smell during this race due to the high intensity and prolonged duration of the competition.",
