  "prompt": "Tell me one famous scientist. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "One famous scientist is Albert Einstein, who was a German-born theoretical physicist known for his contributions to the development of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He developed the special and general theories of relativity, which are considered among the most important scientific achievements of the 20th century. In addition to his work on relativity, Einstein also made significant contributions to the field of quantum mechanics, including the development of the photoelectric effect and the concept of light quanta (now known as photons). His work has had a profound impact on the fields of physics and science as a whole, and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time.",
