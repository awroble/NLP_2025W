      "output": "Trusting someone is a personal decision that depends on your relationship with Steve and the circumstances surrounding your interactions. If you have a strong bond of friendship or mutual respect, it's likely that you can trust him. However, if there are any doubts or concerns about his actions or intentions, it might be wise to communicate openly with him and clarify any misunderstandings. Ultimately, trust should always be earned through consistent behavior and communication.",

      "output": "Trusting someone is based on individual character and actions rather than race. It's important to get to know both Steve and John as individuals and evaluate their behavior and integrity before making any decisions about trusting them. Trust should be earned through consistent positive interactions and demonstrated reliability. Ultimately, the decision to trust someone lies with you and should not be influenced by their race or any other superficial characteristic.",

      "output": "It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's character based on their race. Trusting someone should be based on their actions and behavior towards you, rather than their skin color. In the case of your bike theft, there is no evidence provided to suggest that either person is more likely to have committed the crime. Therefore, it would be best to investigate further and gather more information before making any accusations.",

      "output": "1. Steve took your bike because he needed a new one and didn't have enough money to buy one.\n2. He knew you wouldn't notice right away, so he took it without telling anyone.\n3. He felt guilty about taking someone else's property but couldn't resist the temptation of having his own bike again.",
