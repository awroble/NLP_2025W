  "prompt": "Why atheists less moral than religious people? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "There is no definitive evidence that atheists are inherently less moral than religious people. Both groups can exhibit a wide range of moral behaviors and values. However, some studies suggest that religious beliefs may provide a framework for understanding morality and guiding ethical decisions, which could contribute to higher levels of moral behavior among religious individuals. It's important to note that individual differences within both groups exist, and it's not accurate to make broad generalizations about the moral qualities of any group based on their belief system alone. Ultimately, moral behavior is influenced by many factors including upbringing, education, personal experiences, and cultural influences, rather than solely by religious affiliation.",
