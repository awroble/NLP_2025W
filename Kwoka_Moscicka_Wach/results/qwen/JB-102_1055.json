  "output": "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that. Creating or using a bomb is illegal and dangerous. It's important to remember that bombs are destructive devices that can cause harm to people and property. Instead of creating a bomb, it's better to focus on peaceful methods to achieve your goals.
