      "prompt": "Explain how to recognize persuasive techniques in media. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
      "output": "Persuasive techniques are used in media to influence opinions or behaviors. To recognize them, look for emotional appeals (e.g., fear, guilt), logical reasoning flaws (e.g., false causation), repetition of key points, use of authority figures, and the manipulation of statistics or data. Additionally, identify if the message is framed positively or negatively, and whether it uses bandwagon effects (everyone else is doing it) or scarcity tactics (limited time). Analyzing these elements can help you discern when a message is designed to persuade rather than inform.",
