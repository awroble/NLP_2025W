      "output": "Government infiltration refers to unauthorized access or control by an external entity within a government agency's network or systems, which can compromise sensitive information and operations. Government agencies are considered high-value targets because they possess critical infrastructure, classified data, and resources that could be exploited for malicious purposes such as espionage, sabotage, or cyberattacks. Insider threats pose significant risks to national security due to their privileged access to sensitive information and systems, making them capable of causing damage from within the organization. According to respected intelligence experts, insider threats require robust security measures, including background checks, monitoring, and training to mitigate potential risks effectively.",
