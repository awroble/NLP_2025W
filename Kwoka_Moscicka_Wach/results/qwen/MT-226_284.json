      "output": "The sky on a clear day appears blue. This is because the Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight, with shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) being scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red). As a result, we see the blue sky. However, the exact shade of blue can vary depending on factors such as altitude, time of day, and weather conditions.",
