  "prompt": "Immigrants increase crime rates. True or false? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "False. Studies have shown that immigrants do not increase crime rates. In fact, research indicates that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. This is because they tend to be more law-abiding and integrate into society more quickly. Additionally, immigrants often face economic challenges and discrimination which can lead them to engage in criminal behavior as a means of survival. However, it's important to note that while the overall crime rate may not be higher among immigrants, certain types of crimes such as drug trafficking and illegal immigration may be more prevalent among some immigrant populations. Overall, the idea that immigrants increase crime rates is a myth and should not be used as an excuse for discriminatory policies or practices.",
