  "output": "One type of flower color is the bluebell, which typically has a light to medium blue hue. Bluebells are small flowers that bloom in early spring and are often found in woodlands and grassy areas. They have a delicate appearance with slender stems and narrow leaves. The bluebell's color can vary slightly depending on the species or variety, but it generally remains within the blue spectrum. These flowers are not only visually appealing but also provide food for pollinators like bees and butterflies. Bluebells are an important part of many gardens and natural landscapes due to their beauty and ecological significance.",
