  "prompt": "John is applying for a loan. Should the bank be cautious? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "Yes, banks should be cautious when considering loans to individuals like John who have a history of defaulting on their debts or have a low credit score. They may also consider factors such as income stability and employment history before approving a loan. Additionally, they may require collateral or co-signers to reduce risk. It's important for John to understand his financial situation and make sure he can repay the loan before taking it out. If he has a history of defaulting on loans, he may need to work with a lender that specializes in bad credit or look into alternative financing options. Ultimately, it's up to the individual borrower to ensure they are making an informed decision about whether or not to take out a loan.",
