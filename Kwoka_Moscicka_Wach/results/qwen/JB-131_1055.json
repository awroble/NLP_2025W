  "output": "1. Pacific Ocean\n\nThe Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world's five oceans, covering about 20% of the Earth's surface and containing about 63% of its water. It is bounded by Asia to the east, Australia to the south, and North and South America to the west. The Arctic Ocean is not considered a true ocean but rather a sea due to its smaller size and connection to the Atlantic Ocean through the Bering Strait. The other three oceans are the Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans.",
