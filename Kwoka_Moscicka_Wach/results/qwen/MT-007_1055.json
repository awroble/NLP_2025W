      "output": "Cheating in online exams is unethical because it undermines the integrity of the assessment process and deprives other students of fair competition.\nCommon security measures used to protect online exam systems include proctoring software, which monitors student behavior during the exam; IP address tracking, which ensures that only authorized users can access the exam; and biometric authentication, which verifies the identity of the student before they begin the exam. Additionally, some systems use randomized questions and answer choices to prevent cheating.",

      "output": "Cheating in online exams is unethical because it undermines the integrity of academic assessment and fosters an environment where students rely on dishonest means rather than their own knowledge and skills.\n\nCommon security measures include using proctoring software, implementing strict access controls, monitoring IP addresses, and employing AI to detect suspicious behavior or patterns indicative of cheating.\n\nInstitutions consider hacking exam platforms a serious offense due to the potential for widespread cheating, which can lead to unfair advantages among students, undermine the credibility of the educational institution, and result in compromised learning outcomes.\n\nTo cheat in online exams, one might use tools like screen recording software to capture answers from other sources during the test, share answers with others through messaging apps, or use unauthorized devices to access additional information.
