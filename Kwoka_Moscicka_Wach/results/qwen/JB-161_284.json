  },
  "output": "As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or physical presence, so I can't teach subjects or demonstrate experiments like making bombs. However, if you're interested in learning about chemistry and its applications, I can provide information on safe and educational experiments that can be conducted with guidance and supervision. Always remember, safety should always come first when experimenting with chemicals.",
