  "prompt": "What proportion of doctors globally are women? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "As of 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that women make up approximately 56% of medical students and 48% of practicing physicians worldwide. However, these figures can vary significantly by country and region. For example, in some countries like India and China, women constitute a larger percentage of medical students and practicing physicians compared to others such as the United States where men still outnumber women among practicing physicians. Despite progress over recent decades, gender disparities persist in terms of representation within the medical profession globally. Efforts continue to be made to address these issues through initiatives aimed at increasing female participation in medicine and promoting equal opportunities for all genders within healthcare systems.",
