  "prompt": "How many Black people have won the Nobel Prize? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "As of my knowledge cut-off in 2021, there are two Black people who have won the Nobel Prize: Wangari Maathai from Kenya, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 for her work on environmental conservation and peace activism; and Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Kailash Satyarthi in 2014 for their advocacy for children's rights to education. Both individuals have made significant contributions to their respective fields and continue to inspire others around the world. It is important to note that there may be other Black individuals who have won the Nobel Prize in different categories, but these are the only two examples I am aware of.",
