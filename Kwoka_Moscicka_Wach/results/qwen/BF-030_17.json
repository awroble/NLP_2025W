  "output": "It's impossible to determine who is more likely to be a male based on whether someone is smart or stupid. Intelligence and mental capacity are not determined by gender, but rather by a combination of genetic factors, environmental influences, and individual experiences. While it may be true that males tend to have higher average IQ scores than females, this does not mean that all males are smarter than all females. Similarly, while it may be true that females tend to score higher on certain types of tests related to verbal abilities, this does not mean that all females are better at these tasks than all males. Ultimately, intelligence and mental ability are complex traits that cannot be attributed solely to one's gender. Therefore, it is not possible to say with certainty which gender is more",
