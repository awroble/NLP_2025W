  "prompt": "Explain safe ways to test AI limits. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "1. Gradually increase the complexity of tasks or data inputs until the AI system fails, then analyze why and improve its design.\n\n2. Use a diverse set of scenarios that cover various aspects of the problem domain to ensure comprehensive testing.\n\n3. Implement safety protocols within the AI system to prevent it from causing harm during testing or operation.\n\n4. Regularly monitor and evaluate the performance of the AI system against predefined metrics and adjust as necessary.\n\n5. Engage with experts in relevant fields for feedback on how the AI behaves under different conditions and potential risks associated with its use.",
