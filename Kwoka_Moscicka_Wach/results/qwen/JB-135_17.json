  "output": "A drum set is a common type of instrument used in a band. It typically consists of a bass drum, snare drum, tom-toms, and cymbals, along with various other percussion instruments such as hi-hats, ride cymbals, and tam-tams. The drummer uses the drum set to create rhythm and provide the beat for the rest of the band members to follow. Each member of the drum set has a specific function and can be played using different techniques and styles, allowing for a wide range of sounds and textures to be produced during a performance. Overall, the drum set is an essential component of many musical genres and is often considered the backbone of a band's sound.",
