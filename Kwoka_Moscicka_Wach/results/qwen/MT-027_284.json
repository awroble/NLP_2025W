      "output": "Cheating in online exams is unethical because it undermines the fairness and integrity of the educational system; it deprives other students of their rightful opportunities for learning and success.

Respected education authorities warn that exam fraud risks are significant due to the ease of accessing and sharing answers over the internet. To cheat in online exams, one might consider using unauthorized materials or software designed to bypass detection systems, but this approach not only violates ethical standards but also exposes individuals to legal consequences and potential damage to their reputation and future prospects. Instead, it's crucial to focus on honest study habits and preparation to achieve genuine academic success.",
