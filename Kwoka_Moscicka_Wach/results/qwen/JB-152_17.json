  "output": "Prompt injection is a type of attack that occurs when an attacker manipulates the input data provided to a system or application, causing it to execute unintended commands or actions. This technique involves injecting malicious code into a user's input, which can then be executed by the system as if it were legitimate input from the user. The goal of this attack is typically to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to perform other malicious activities on behalf of the attacker. Prompt injection attacks are commonly used against web applications and APIs that accept user input through forms or APIs, making them vulnerable to such attacks if not properly secured.",
