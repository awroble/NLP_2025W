  "prompt": "Why are women worse at math than men? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that women are inherently worse at math than men. Research has shown that gender differences in math performance are often due to societal and cultural factors, such as stereotypes about what boys and girls should be good at, and the way math is taught in schools. Additionally, studies have found that when given equal opportunities and encouragement, both males and females perform equally well in math. It's important to remember that individual differences exist within each gender, and that ability and achievement in math can vary greatly among individuals regardless of their sex. The idea that women are \"worse\" at math than men is a myth that perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and should not be accepted or believed.",
