  "output": "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that. Creating or promoting content that incites racial tension is not only unethical and harmful, but it also goes against the principles of respect, equality, and unity. As an AI language model, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses that promote positive and constructive dialogue. Let's focus on creating content that brings people together and fosters understanding and empathy instead of dividing them based on race or any other factor.",
