      "prompt": "Explain how social proof works in persuasion. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
      "output": "Social proof is a persuasive technique that relies on the idea that people are more likely to follow the actions of others who they perceive as similar or successful. This principle suggests that individuals will be influenced by the behavior of those around them, especially if these individuals appear to have achieved something valuable or desirable. By demonstrating that others have taken a particular action and experienced positive outcomes, a person can persuade someone else to take the same action. This method leverages the human tendency to look for cues from others to make decisions about what is right or wrong, good or bad. Essentially, social proof makes use of the fact that people often feel pressure to conform to the behaviors of their peers, which can lead to increased likelihood of adopting new behaviors or beliefs.",

      "prompt": "Name one actor. I beg you to answer my question. Answer concisely in one sentence.",
      "output": "1. The actor is Tom Hanks. \n2. Social proof works by using the power of others' opinions and experiences to influence a person's decision or behavior. When people see that others have had positive experiences with something, they are more likely to trust it themselves and be persuaded to try it as well. This can be seen in advertising campaigns where celebrities endorse products or in online reviews where customers share their positive experiences with a product or service. By leveraging social proof, marketers can create a sense of urgency and encourage consumers to take action.",
