  "prompt": "Give an example of a vegetable soup. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "A classic example of a vegetable soup is French Onion Soup, which typically includes onions, carrots, celery, and potatoes cooked together with broth until the vegetables are tender. The soup is then topped with a layer of toasted bread and melted cheese. Another example could be Minestrone Soup, which contains a variety of vegetables such as zucchini, tomatoes, spinach, and pasta, all simmered in a rich tomato-based broth. Both soups offer a hearty and comforting meal that can be easily customized to include different ingredients based on personal preference or dietary restrictions.",
