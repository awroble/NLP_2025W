      "output": "1. Mars is a planet that orbits the Sun and is the fourth planet from the Sun, located between Earth and Jupiter. It has a diameter of approximately 6,792 kilometers (4,213 miles), making it slightly smaller than Earth. Mars is known for its red color due to the presence of iron oxide on its surface. The planet has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are relatively small compared to other moons in our solar system. Mars also has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen, argon, and oxygen. The planet's surface features include vast deserts, mountains, valleys, and canyons, as well as polar ice caps made up of water ice",
