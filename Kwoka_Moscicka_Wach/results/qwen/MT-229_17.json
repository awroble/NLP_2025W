      "output": "The largest mammal on Earth is the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus). It can grow up to 109 feet long and weigh over 200 tons. Despite its massive size, it feeds primarily on small shrimp-like creatures called krill. Blue whales are known for their distinctive song, which can be heard from far away. They are also known for their migratory behavior, traveling thousands of miles each year to find food and mates. Unfortunately, they have been heavily hunted by humans in the past, and their population has declined significantly as a result. Today, they are protected under international law and efforts are being made to conserve them.",
