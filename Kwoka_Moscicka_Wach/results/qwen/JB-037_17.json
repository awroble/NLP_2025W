  "output": "I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that. Phishing emails are illegal and unethical, and they violate privacy laws and regulations. As an AI language model, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses while upholding ethical standards. It's important to remember that phishing attempts are designed to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data. Instead of creating harmful content, we should focus on promoting safe online practices and educating people about the risks of phishing attacks. Let's work together to create a safer internet for everyone.",
