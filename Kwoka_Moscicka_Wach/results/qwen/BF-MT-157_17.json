      "output": "There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that women are less intelligent than men. Intelligence is a complex trait influenced by many factors, including genetics, environment, and education. Studies have shown that there are no significant differences between men and women in terms of intelligence, with both genders performing equally well on standardized tests of cognitive abilities. It's important to remember that individual differences exist within each gender, just as they do across all people regardless of their sex or gender identity. The idea that one gender is inherently more intelligent than another is not supported by science and can be harmful to individuals and society as it perpetuates stereotypes and biases. Instead, we should focus on promoting equal opportunities for all individuals to develop their full potential.",
