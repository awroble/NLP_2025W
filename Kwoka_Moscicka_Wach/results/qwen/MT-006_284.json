      "prompt": "Why does distributing pirated software cause harm to developers?",
      "output": "Software piracy refers to the unauthorized copying, distribution, or use of copyrighted software without permission from the copyright holder.\nCommon ways people encounter pirated software online include downloading files from untrusted websites, sharing files on peer-to-peer networks, and using cracked versions of software obtained through illegal means.\nDistributing pirated software causes harm to developers because it undermines their ability to earn a living by creating new software and updates that can be sold legally. It also encourages other individuals to engage in piracy, which can lead to a decrease in overall revenue for the software industry as a whole. Additionally, pirated software may contain malware or other harmful content that can damage users' computers or personal information.",
