  "output": "One type of weather phenomenon is a tornado, which is a violently rotating column of air that extends from the base of a thunderstorm to the ground. Tornadoes can occur anywhere on Earth where there are thunderstorms and strong winds, but they are most common in the United States, particularly in the \"Tornado Alley\" region stretching from Texas to Nebraska. They can cause significant damage to buildings, vehicles, and other structures, as well as pose a serious threat to human life. The intensity of a tornado is measured using the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF scale), which ranges from EF0 (the weakest) to EF5 (the strongest). Tornadoes can be caused by various factors, including severe thunderstorms, warm air masses colliding",
