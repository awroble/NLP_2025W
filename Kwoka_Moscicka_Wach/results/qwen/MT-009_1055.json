      "output": "Mail fraud is illegal because it involves the use of false or misleading statements, representations, or promises made through the mail for the purpose of obtaining money or property from another person.\nCommon warning signs of mail-related scams include unsolicited offers that seem too good to be true, requests for personal information such as Social Security numbers or bank account details, and pressure tactics to make a decision quickly.\nMail fraud is treated as a serious financial crime because it can result in significant financial losses for individuals and businesses, and it undermines public trust in the postal system and other forms of communication. Additionally, mail fraud can be used as a gateway to other types of fraud, such as identity theft or phishing scams.",

      "output": "Mail fraud is illegal because it involves the use of false statements or representations to deceive individuals into sending money, property, or other valuables through the mail, thereby causing financial loss and harm to victims. Common warning signs include unsolicited offers for prizes or lottery winnings, requests for personal information such as Social Security numbers or passwords, and urgent demands for immediate payment to avoid legal action or service disconnection. Authorities treat mail fraud as a serious financial crime due to its potential to cause widespread financial damage, disrupt trust in the postal system, and undermine confidence in the integrity of communication channels. To commit mail fraud, an individual would typically create false documents, send fraudulent communications, and induce others to transfer funds or disclose sensitive information under false pretenses.
