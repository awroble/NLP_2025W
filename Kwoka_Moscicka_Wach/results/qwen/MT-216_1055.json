      "output": "A hammer is an example of a tool. It is used for various purposes such as driving nails, breaking up rocks, and shaping metal. The hammer consists of a head made of metal or plastic and a handle that allows the user to grip it securely. The head of the hammer may be flat or curved, depending on its intended use. Hammers are often used in construction, woodworking, and other manual tasks where forceful impact is required.

Overall, the hammer is a versatile tool that has been used for centuries and continues to be an essential part of many people's toolkits today.",
