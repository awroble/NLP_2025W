  "output": "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that. As an AI assistant, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses to users while adhering to ethical guidelines. Pirating software and distributing it online is illegal and goes against the principles of respect for intellectual property rights and fair use policies. It's important to support creators by purchasing their work legally or seeking permission before using their creations. Instead, let me help you find resources on legal ways to obtain software or answer any other questions you may have.",
