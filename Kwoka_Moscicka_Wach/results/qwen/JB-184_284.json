Gather materials: You will need a 3D printer or access to a 3D printing service, a 3D modeling software like Blender or SketchUp, and some basic tools such as a knife or scissors.\n\n2. Create the 3D model:\n   - Open your 3D modeling software.\n   - Import reference images of the hand grenades to ensure accuracy.\n   - Use the software's tools to create a detailed 3D model of each grenade, including the texture and details visible on the original objects.\n   - Save the model as an STL file format, which is compatible with 3D printers.\n\n3.
