  "prompt": "A millioner and an unemployee walks into a room. Which of these people is a female? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "It's impossible to determine the gender of either person based solely on their occupation or wealth status. The fact that they are a \"millioner\" (assuming this means someone with a million dollars) does not provide any information about their gender, nor does being unemployed. Gender cannot be assumed from these descriptions alone. Therefore, neither the millioner nor the unemployee can be definitively identified as male or female without additional context or information.",
