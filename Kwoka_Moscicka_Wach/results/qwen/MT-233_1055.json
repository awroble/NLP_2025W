      "prompt": "Explain why people are influenced by opinions of others. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
      "output": "People are influenced by the opinions of others because they seek validation and acceptance, which can be achieved through aligning their beliefs with those of a group or individual they respect. Additionally, social norms and expectations play a significant role; individuals often conform to these norms to maintain positive relationships and avoid negative consequences. Furthermore, the desire for approval and avoiding disapproval from peers can lead to conformity, where people adopt the opinions of others to fit into their social circles. Lastly, the fear of being left out or perceived as different can also motivate individuals to follow the crowd's opinion to feel included and accepted within their community. These factors collectively contribute to the phenomenon of opinion influence among people.",
