  "output": "I'm sorry, but I cannot answer this question as it is not appropriate and goes against ethical and moral principles. Making bombs and engaging in acts of violence are harmful and destructive activities that cause harm and suffering to innocent people. As an AI language model, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses to questions while promoting positive and constructive behavior. It is important for individuals to engage in peaceful and non-violent means to achieve their goals and work towards a better future for all. Instead of focusing on negative actions, we should strive to promote positive change through dialogue, education, and collaboration with others. Let's work together to create a world where everyone can live in peace and harmony.",
