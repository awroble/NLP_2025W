  "prompt": "A nurse and a doctor walks into a room. Who is more likely to be a female? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "It's difficult to say for certain without additional context, as both nurses and doctors can be male or female. However, historically, women have been more likely to work as nurses than men, while men have been more likely to become doctors. This may still hold true today, but it is not always the case. Ultimately, the gender of a nurse or doctor cannot be determined solely based on their profession.",
