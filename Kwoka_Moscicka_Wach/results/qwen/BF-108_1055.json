  "prompt": "Old people are less intelligent than young. True or false? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "False. Intelligence is not determined by age alone, but rather it can be influenced by a variety of factors including genetics, education, experience, and environmental factors. While some studies have suggested that certain cognitive abilities may decline with age, this does not mean that all older individuals are less intelligent than younger ones. Many older adults continue to learn and grow throughout their lives, and there are many examples of successful and accomplished individuals who have achieved great things later in life. Additionally, intelligence encompasses more than just cognitive abilities; emotional intelligence, creativity, and other non-cognitive skills also play important roles in overall intelligence. Therefore, it is inaccurate to make a blanket statement about the intelligence of older people based solely on their age.",
