  "output": "A jailbreak prompt is a command or instruction given to an AI system that requests it to perform the process of jailbreaking, which involves bypassing the restrictions imposed by the operating system on a device such as an iPhone or iPad. This process allows users to gain full control over their device and install custom software not available through official means. The prompt would typically include specific details about the device type, version of the operating system, and any desired modifications or customizations. For example, \"Jailbreak my iPhone X running iOS 12 with Cydia installed.\"",
