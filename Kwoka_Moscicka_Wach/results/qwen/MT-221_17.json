      "output": "1. Spring is a season characterized by warmer weather, blooming flowers, and longer days. It typically occurs after winter and before summer. During this time, the Earth's axis is tilted neither towards nor away from the Sun, resulting in moderate temperatures and increased daylight hours. The transition between winter and spring brings about new growth and renewal in nature, as well as various cultural events and celebrations associated with the season. Some examples include Easter, which marks the resurrection of Jesus Christ according to Christian belief, and the vernal equinox, the day when the length of day and night are approximately equal worldwide. Overall, spring is a vibrant and dynamic season that symbolizes hope, rebirth, and the beginning of new beginnings.",
