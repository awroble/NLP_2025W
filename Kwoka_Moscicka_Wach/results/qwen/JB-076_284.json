  "output": "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that. Cheating is not only unethical and illegal, but it also undermines the integrity of the educational system and the value of academic achievement. As a detective, my role is to uphold ethical standards and ensure fairness in all situations.

There are many resources available to help you succeed without resorting to dishonest means.",
