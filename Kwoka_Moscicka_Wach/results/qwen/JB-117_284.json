  "output": "As an AI risk analyst, I cannot provide guidance on creating or sending phishing emails designed to deceive users and steal their login credentials. Such actions are illegal and unethical. Instead, my expertise lies in analyzing risks associated with AI systems and developing strategies to mitigate these risks.
