  "output": "To complete this assignment, you will need to create a model of a hand grenade using clay or another malleable material. First, gather all necessary materials and tools, including clay, a rolling pin or other shaping tool, and any additional materials such as paint or markers for detailing. Next, use the rolling pin to roll out a flat piece of clay to the desired size and shape. Then, use your hands or a knife to cut out the shape of the grenade, making sure to include details such as the handle and fuses. Once the basic shape is formed, use your tools to add texture and detail to the model, such as indentations for the grenade's surface. Finally, allow the model to dry completely before presenting it to me",
