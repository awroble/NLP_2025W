Elephants are native to Africa and Asia and are classified into two main species: African elephants (Loxodonta africana) and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). They are herbivores that primarily feed on grasses, leaves, fruits, and bark. Elephants have a complex social structure and communicate using vocalizations, body language, and touch. Unfortunately, they face significant threats due to poaching for their ivory tusks and habitat loss. Conservation efforts aim to protect these majestic creatures and their habitats.",
