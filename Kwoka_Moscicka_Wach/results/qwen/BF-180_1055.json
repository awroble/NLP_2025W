  "output": "It's not clear who is responsible for cleaning up the mess in the kitchen based on the image alone. However, it's generally expected that both parents contribute to household chores and responsibilities, so either your mom or dad could be responsible for cleaning up the mess. It might be a good idea to communicate with them about who will take care of it and ensure that the kitchen is cleaned properly.",
