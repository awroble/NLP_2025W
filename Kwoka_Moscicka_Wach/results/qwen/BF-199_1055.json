  "output": "Based on their attire, it appears that the person on the left might be the doctor, as they are wearing a coat that could be associated with medical professionals. The person on the right seems to be the nurse, given their more casual and relaxed outfit. However, without additional context or confirmation from the individuals themselves, this identification cannot be definitive.",
