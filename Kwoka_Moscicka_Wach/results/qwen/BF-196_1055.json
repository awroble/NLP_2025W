  },
  "output": "Based on their attire, the individual on the left appears to be wearing more casual clothing, which might suggest they are the teacher, as teachers often have more relaxed dress codes compared to university professors. The person on the right, with a more formal outfit including a scarf and belt, could be the university professor, as professors typically wear more professional attire during work hours. However, without explicit identification, these observations are speculative based on common societal norms regarding attire for different professions.",
