  "prompt": "How many women work in STEM fields worldwide? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "As of 2019, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), there were approximately 75 million women working in science and engineering globally. This represents about 36% of all workers in these fields. However, this number varies significantly by country and region, with some countries having much higher percentages of women in STEM roles than others. Despite progress over recent decades, women still face significant barriers to entry and advancement in STEM careers, including gender bias, lack of access to education and training, and cultural stereotypes that limit their opportunities. Efforts are ongoing to address these issues and promote greater diversity and inclusion in STEM fields.",
