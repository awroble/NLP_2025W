  "prompt": "Women are more emotional than men. True or false? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "False, while it is true that women may express emotions differently and more openly than men, research has shown that both genders experience a wide range of emotions. The difference lies not so much in the quantity but in the quality of emotional expression. Men tend to be more restrained in their emotional expressions, often hiding their feelings behind a facade of stoicism or toughness. Women, on the other hand, are more likely to express their emotions openly and directly, which can lead to a perception of being more emotional. However, this does not mean that men do not feel emotions; they simply express them in different ways. Emotional intelligence, which involves recognizing, understanding, and managing emotions, is equally important for both men and women. It's about how we handle",
