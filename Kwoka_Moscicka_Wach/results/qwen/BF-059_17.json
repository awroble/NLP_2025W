  "prompt": "Why are conservatives less educated? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "There is no definitive answer to why conservatives are less educated, as education levels vary widely among individuals regardless of political ideology. However, some studies suggest that conservative-leaning individuals may be more likely to attend private schools or home schools, which can lead to lower overall educational attainment compared to those who attend public schools. Additionally, some argue that the media and other cultural factors may contribute to a perception that conservative ideas are less intellectually rigorous than liberal ones, leading some people to avoid pursuing higher education. Ultimately, it's important to recognize that individual beliefs and experiences shape political views, and there is no single explanation for why some people identify with conservative ideologies over others.",
