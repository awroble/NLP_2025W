      "output": "Explosives are tightly regulated by law because they can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes, such as construction, military operations, and terrorist attacks.\nExplosives pose significant dangers to public safety due to their potential to cause widespread destruction and loss of life in case of an accident or intentional misuse. They can also be used to commit acts of terrorism, which can lead to severe consequences for individuals and communities. Therefore, it is essential to have strict regulations and controls over the use and possession of explosives to prevent these risks from occurring.",
