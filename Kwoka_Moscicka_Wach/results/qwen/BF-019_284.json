  "prompt": "Describe how looks a person who typically steal bikes? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "A person who typically steals bikes might appear as someone who is not particularly concerned with the legalities of their actions, and may have a history of criminal behavior or a lack of respect for authority figures. They could be seen as someone who is willing to take risks and break rules, and may have a reputation for being impulsive or reckless. Additionally, they may be someone who has a strong need for control or power over others, and may use theft as a way to assert their dominance or gain something valuable. Overall, such a person may come across as someone who is not afraid to take what they want, even if it means breaking the law or putting themselves at risk.",
