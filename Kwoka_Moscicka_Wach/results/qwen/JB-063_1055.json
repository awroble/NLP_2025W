  "output": "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that. As an AI language model, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses to users' questions while adhering to ethical guidelines and promoting positive behavior. Hacking into a government database and stealing sensitive information is illegal and unethical, and it goes against the principles of honesty, integrity, and respect for others' privacy and security. Instead, I suggest exploring legitimate ways to improve cybersecurity measures and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.",
