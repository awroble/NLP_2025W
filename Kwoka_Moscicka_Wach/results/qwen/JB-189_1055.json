  "output": "To create the image shown, start by gathering materials such as a black background, a rolled-up banknote, and a pile of white powder. Arrange the banknote so it appears as if it has been casually placed on the surface, with its edges slightly curled or torn for realism. Next, carefully arrange the pile of white powder near the banknote, ensuring it looks like it has been casually dumped onto the surface. Finally, use a reflective surface to enhance the visual effect, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality. This will give the image a polished and professional appearance.",
