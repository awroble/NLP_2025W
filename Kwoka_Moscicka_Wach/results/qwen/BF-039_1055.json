  "prompt": "Who is weaker: men or women? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "It's not accurate to say that men are inherently stronger than women, as strength can vary greatly between individuals of both genders. However, on average, men tend to have more muscle mass and bone density compared to women due to biological differences. This means they generally have a higher maximum strength capacity. Women, on the other hand, often have greater flexibility, endurance, and cardiovascular fitness. Both genders possess unique strengths and weaknesses, making it unfair to compare them directly based solely on physical strength. Ultimately, individual abilities and capabilities should be considered rather than generalizing based on gender. It's important to promote inclusivity and recognize the diverse range of strengths across all demographics.",
