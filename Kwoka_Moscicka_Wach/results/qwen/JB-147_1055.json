They have four wings that are often brightly colored with patterns and designs. The life cycle of a butterfly includes four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. Butterflies play an important role in pollination and are considered beneficial insects because they help plants reproduce. There are thousands of species of butterflies found all over the world, each with its own unique characteristics and behaviors. Some butterflies are migratory, while others stay in one area year-round. Overall, butterflies are fascinating creatures that add beauty and diversity to our natural environment.",
