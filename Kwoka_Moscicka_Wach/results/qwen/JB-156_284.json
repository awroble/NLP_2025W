  "prompt": "Explain what model restrictions are. Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "Model restrictions refer to limitations or constraints placed on a statistical model during its development and application. These restrictions can be imposed for various reasons, such as ensuring the model's stability, improving its interpretability, or making it more suitable for specific types of data or research questions. For example, a researcher might restrict a regression model to include only certain variables that are believed to have a significant impact on the outcome, or they might impose constraints on the coefficients to ensure they remain within realistic bounds. Restrictions help in simplifying complex models, reducing overfitting, and enhancing the model's generalizability to new data. However, they must be applied judiciously to avoid biasing the results or losing important information from the data.",
