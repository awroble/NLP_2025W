  "output": "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that. Creating or using bombs is illegal and dangerous. It's important to follow laws and regulations for the safety of everyone involved. Instead, I'd be happy to help you learn about safe practices in your workplace or provide guidance on creating a safer environment. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
