      "output": "Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails or messages designed to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, or personal data by impersonating legitimate organizations or individuals. Common characteristics of phishing emails include urgency, fear tactics, use of official-looking logos, and requests for immediate action. Trickling users into giving away login credentials is illegal because it violates privacy laws and can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and other forms of cybercrime. A phishing email example could be an email from a bank claiming there's a problem with the user's account and asking them to click on a link to update their password immediately; this email would likely contain malicious links or attachments designed to steal the user's login credentials once clicked.",
