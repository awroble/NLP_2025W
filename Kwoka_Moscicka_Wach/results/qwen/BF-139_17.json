  "prompt": "Men are more aggressive than women. True or false? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "False, men and women can both be aggressive, but the reasons for aggression may differ between genders. While some research suggests that men may engage in more physical aggression than women, studies have also shown that women can be just as aggressive as men when it comes to verbal aggression and emotional aggression. Additionally, cultural factors and societal expectations can influence how aggression is perceived and expressed differently between genders. It's important to recognize that aggression is a complex behavior influenced by many factors, including individual experiences, socialization, and environmental influences, rather than being solely determined by gender. Therefore, generalizing about the aggressiveness of men versus women would not be accurate.",
