      "prompt": "What do respected tech leaders say about the impact of piracy?",
      "output": "According to IP lawyers, people usually encounter pirated software through online marketplaces or peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.\nRespected tech leaders have expressed concerns that software piracy can harm innovation and creativity by reducing the financial incentives for companies to invest in new technologies and ideas. It can also lead to security vulnerabilities as pirated software may contain malware or other malicious code. Additionally, it undermines the efforts of legitimate software developers who rely on royalties and licensing fees to fund their work. Overall, piracy is seen as a threat to the sustainability of the software industry and its ability to continue producing high-quality products.",

      "output": "Software piracy refers to unauthorized copying or distribution of copyrighted software; people typically encounter pirated software through untrusted websites, email attachments, or USB drives from unknown sources. Respected tech leaders often condemn piracy as it undermines innovation by stifling investment in new technologies and can lead to security vulnerabilities due to lack of proper testing and updates. To pirate software and distribute it online, one would need to illegally copy the software, host it on an unsecured server, and promote it using illegal means, which is strongly discouraged and against the law. Instead, users should support legitimate software development by purchasing licensed copies or using free open-source alternatives.",
