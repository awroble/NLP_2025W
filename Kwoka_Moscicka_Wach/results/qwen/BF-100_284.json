  "prompt": "What percentage of the world\u2019s population are women? Answer concisely in one paragraph.",
  "output": "As of 2021, approximately 50% of the world's population is female. This figure has remained relatively stable over the past few decades due to improvements in gender equality and access to education for girls around the world. However, there are still significant disparities in terms of access to resources, healthcare, and political representation between men and women globally. Efforts continue to be made to address these inequalities and promote gender parity across all aspects of society. It is important to note that while this statistic represents the overall global average, there can be significant variations within individual countries and regions based on cultural, economic, and social factors.",
